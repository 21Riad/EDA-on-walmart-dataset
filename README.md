## Overview

In the initial phase of our comprehensive analysis, we rigorously conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sizable dataset obtained from Walmart. This multifaceted process involved a systematic exploration of the data, followed by meticulous structuring through advanced feature engineering techniques. Subsequently, a thorough data cleaning and taking out outliers to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the dataset. Without delay, we transitioned seamlessly into the visualization stage, employing sophisticated techniques to distill meaningful insights from the data. This strategic progression from foundational exploration to insightful visualization is pivotal in unraveling valuable patterns and trends, forming the bedrock of our analytical endeavors and decision-making processes.

## Business Understanding

Within the ambit of business understanding, our focal task involved a meticulous visualization of charts delineating Walmart sales data. The primary objective was to glean comprehensive insights into sales patterns, affording us the ability to discern fluctuations and identify periods of subdued sales. By scrutinizing the data over successive seasons, months, and weeks, our aim was to pinpoint specific temporal intervals characterized by lower sales figures.

## Data Understanding

This is the historical data that covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01, in the file Walmart_Store_sales. Refer to [Walmart Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset/data) for more informations.

## Visualization

Following the execution of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python to refine and cleanse our dataset, we seamlessly transitioned into the realm of data visualization using Tableau Public. Leveraging the advanced capabilities of Tableau, we meticulously crafted an interactive dashboard that serves as a dynamic visualization of our analytical findings. This user-friendly interface encapsulates the essence of our insights, allowing stakeholders to explore the nuances of the data effortlessly. For your convenience, the interactive dashboard is accessible through the following [link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/riad.madouni/viz/WalmartAnalysis_16998897096320/Tableaudebord2), providing a comprehensive and visually engaging overview of our data-driven discoveries.

## Conclusion

In the end, our analytical journey has traversed the intricate landscape of data exploration, refinement, and visualization. Through the integration of Python for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the transformative capabilities of Tableau Public, we have unraveled nuanced insights into Walmart sales. Notably, as part of our meticulous approach, we conducted a thorough examination of linear regression assumptions. This involved examined attribute correlations and evaluating the significance of each variable through p-values, laying the foundation for potential linear regression analyses in the future.
